ChemBioDraw Ultra 130 is a powerful tool for drawing and analyzing chemical and biological structures. It is widely used by researchers, educators, students and professionals in the fields of chemistry, biology, pharmacology, biotechnology, medicine and more. ChemBioDraw Ultra 130 helps users to create high-quality graphics, perform complex calculations, explore molecular properties and interactions, and communicate their findings effectively.

In this article, we will provide a brief overview of some of the main features and functions of ChemBioDraw Ultra 130. We will also show some examples of how ChemBioDraw Ultra 130 can be used to create and analyze chemical and biological structures.
 
## ChemDraw: The World's Leading Chemical Drawing Program
 
ChemDraw is the core component of ChemBioDraw Ultra 130. It allows users to draw chemical structures using a variety of tools and options. Users can choose from different drawing modes, such as bond, chain, ring, template, text, arrow, bracket and shape. Users can also customize the appearance and properties of atoms, bonds, labels, charges, radicals and stereochemistry. ChemDraw supports different structure and style templates, such as ACS Document 1996, IUPAC 2005 and Biochemistry. ChemDraw also provides hotkeys for common actions and commands, such as copy, paste, rotate, flip, zoom and undo.
 
ChemDraw can automatically clean up structures to improve their clarity and consistency. It can also check structures for errors and warnings, such as valence violations, overlapping atoms or bonds, ambiguous stereochemistry and unresolved R-groups. ChemDraw can also generate names for structures using different nomenclature systems, such as IUPAC, CAS and SMILES. ChemDraw can also convert names to structures and vice versa.
 
ChemDraw can create publication-quality graphics for reports, presentations, posters and journals. Users can export graphics in different formats, such as PNG, JPEG, TIFF, EPS and PDF. Users can also copy and paste graphics to other applications, such as Microsoft Word, PowerPoint and Excel. ChemDraw can also create ChemDraw ActiveX/Plugin objects that can be embedded in web pages or documents. These objects allow users to view and interact with structures online or offline.

 ![Chemical structure of aspirin](https://i.imgur.com/0Q8l9Zf.png) 
This is the chemical structure of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), a common painkiller and anti-inflammatory drug. The structure shows the atoms (represented by symbols), bonds (represented by lines), charges (represented by + or - signs), stereochemistry (represented by wedges or dashes) and name (written below the structure). The structure was drawn using the ACS Document 1996 style template and the IUPAC nomenclature system.
