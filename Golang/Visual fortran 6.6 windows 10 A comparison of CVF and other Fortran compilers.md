# How to Install Visual Fortran 6.6 on Windows 10
 
Visual Fortran 6.6 is a legacy compiler that was developed by Compaq and later acquired by Intel. It is no longer supported or updated by Intel, but some users may still need it for their old Fortran applications. However, installing Visual Fortran 6.6 on Windows 10 can be challenging, as it was designed for Windows XP and earlier versions of Windows. In this article, we will show you how to install Visual Fortran 6.6 on Windows 10 using two methods: using compatibility mode and using a virtual machine.
 
## Method 1: Using Compatibility Mode
 
Compatibility mode is a feature of Windows that allows you to run older programs that were not designed for your current version of Windows. To use compatibility mode to install Visual Fortran 6.6 on Windows 10, follow these steps:
 
**DOWNLOAD ○○○ [https://t.co/2A7qNT68qb](https://t.co/2A7qNT68qb)**


 
1. Download the Visual Fortran 6.6 installer from a reliable source, such as [Intel Communities](https://community.intel.com/t5/Intel-Fortran-Compiler/download-compaq-visual-fortran-6-6/m-p/978081) [^1^] or [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/post/Compaq_Visual_Fortran_Version_6_for_Windows) [^2^], and extract it to a local disk.
2. Right-click on the installer file and select Properties.
3. Go to the Compatibility tab and check the box that says "Run this program in compatibility mode for:".
4. Select "Windows XP (Service Pack 3)" from the drop-down menu.
5. Click Apply and OK.
6. Double-click on the installer file and follow the instructions to complete the installation.

Note that you may need to enter your license number during the installation process. If you have lost your license number, you may need to contact Intel for assistance.

## Method 2: Using a Virtual Machine
 
A virtual machine is a software that allows you to run another operating system within your current operating system. This way, you can install and run Visual Fortran 6.6 on Windows XP without affecting your Windows 10 system. To use a virtual machine to install Visual Fortran 6.6 on Windows 10, follow these steps:

1. Download and install a virtual machine software, such as [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or [VMware Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html).
2. Download a Windows XP ISO image file from a reliable source, such as [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/WinXPProSP3x86).
3. Create a new virtual machine in your virtual machine software and select Windows XP as the operating system.
4. Mount the Windows XP ISO image file as a virtual CD/DVD drive and start the virtual machine.
5. Follow the instructions to install Windows XP on the virtual machine.
6. Download the Visual Fortran 6.6 installer from a reliable source, such as [Intel Communities](https://community.intel.com/t5/Intel-Fortran-Compiler/download-compaq-visual-fortran-6-6/m-p/978081) [^1^] or [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/post/Compaq_Visual_Fortran_Version_6_for_Windows) [^2^], and copy it to the virtual machine.
7. Double-click on the installer file and follow the instructions to complete the installation.

Note that you may need to enter your license number during the installation process. If you have lost your license number, you may need to contact Intel for assistance.
