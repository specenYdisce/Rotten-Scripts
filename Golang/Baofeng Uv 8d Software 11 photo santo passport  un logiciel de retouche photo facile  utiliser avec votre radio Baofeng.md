## Step 1: Take a photo of yourself
 
The first step is to take a photo of yourself that meets the passport requirements. You should have a neutral expression, face the camera directly, and have a plain white or light-colored background. You should also avoid wearing glasses, hats, or anything that covers your face. The photo should be clear and in focus.
